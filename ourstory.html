            <p>Our story is that we love rabbits so we did a rabbit coffee shop for people who love rabbits the same way as us and also who love coffee. We tried for a long time to do this but we finally did it and now people enjoy it which makes us happy and you should come with your friends as well.
                We got different type of coffee and breakfast food plus carrot cake as a dessert.
                We also different businesses like selling products but it didnâ€™t really work so we decided to do something else and this is perfect for us and for our customers.<img src="images/rbb.PNG" height="400px" width="auto"> <img src="images/ras.PNG" height="400px" width="auto">
